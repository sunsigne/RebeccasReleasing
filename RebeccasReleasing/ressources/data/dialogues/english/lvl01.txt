Ok, here I am.
(Sarah)
Great ! Don't forget your mission : steal
their helmet of releasing.
(Rebbecca)
Alright. Anything else ?
(Sarah)
Once you get the helmet, go for the
exit.
And if you can wreck some stuff on the way,
feel free to do !

(Rebbecca)
Sarah ? The door in front of me is locked.
What do I have to do ?
(Sarah)
Their security system in this building isn't
great. You should be able to crochet it.

(Sarah)
Where do you fairy fingers go ?
Your best asset is your right index.
(Sarah)
Almost … Target the bull's eye.

(Rebbecca)
That was easy.
(Sarah)
For now, yes ... But don't mess yourself.
Now your time is running out.
If you fail overcoming a task or if you spend too
much time to do it, your mission is compromised. 
If the mission is compromised 3 times, it fails.
(Rebbecca)
Then ... Like a health point system ?
(Sarah)
Rebbaca ... We are not in a video game ...
Please, focus ...

(Rebbecca)
Sarah, there is a gard before this door ...
(Sarah)
Don't worry, he is alone. You should easily
deal with him.

(Rebbecca)
Ouch …
(Sarah)
You can do it ! Focus your attacks on him,
and focus your defense on yourself.

(Sarah)
Nice ! You should be ok for now.
I'll let you focus on your mission.
(Rebbecca)
Any last tips ?
(Sarah)
Yes ! If you encounter a new type of situation,
try to adapt quickly.
(Rebbecca)
Ok ! See you later.
(Rebbecca)
Well ... Now I need to find this helmet ...
Where can it be ...
